What a New post on the day after the last one, what sorcery is this.  
Well last post I talked about new projects and what was keeping me busy the last few weeks.  
In this post I'm going to explain and/or reveal what one of those projects is.  

#about Project Kenjutsu
A couple of days before the summer vacation started I watched a video on youtube, about someone who was making a VR game as part of being challanged by some commenter.  
ill leave a link at the end of the post if you're interested.  
to give you a quick summary he made a quirky little vr game.  
this got me thinking, I have a VR headset how hard can it be to make a game in VR.  
but then came the question, what do I make.  
after a bit of thinking I decided that for a first VR Game I could simulate Kendo and Iaido a quirky game.  
  
Then i read up on the sports and history and saw its original form Kenjutsu a style practiced by the samurai of old.  
Iaido is based on what samurai did with slashing bamboo stands to meditate and perfect their form.  
While Kendo is more based on the stand-off nature of samurai fighting.  

ill spare you the details about all the forms and stance i had to research and observe.  
since you will be learning those while playing if I finish the first build.  
Armed with Knowledge I set out to start development.  

After a week i had most basic VR Features implemented, but not all the features I need to make the first release.  
in that time i saw cursed flying sword sheaths, Motions sickness, a lot of wall bumping in real life and other quirky stuff.  

at this moment im implementing a VR Body for the use of custom body's and maybe community skins.  
Thats all for now I hope ill have more to share about my progress next time.  


As always.

Your gracious host,
Altair.
