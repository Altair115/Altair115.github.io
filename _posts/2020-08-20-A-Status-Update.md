Hello again,

Long Time no see, am I right.
I don't know how many of you are even reading these posts, since I've yet to implement the comment feature on this blog.
But that's a matter for another time,
As to where have I been its simple to explain.

I'm a student so from time to time that means that my attention lays elsewhere while this sounds like a sad excuse it is.
before the summer vacation started I was looking for a place to get hired as an intern,
which occupied most of my time while still working on my person projects,
As of writing this post I haven't been able to secure myself a spot somewhere.
Part is to blame on the Covid-19 which makes it harder to find said spots.

But enough of that.

What I'm a working on.
Recently I've taken an interest in VR game development.
Mostly because of my time spend with VR games that make you move like (Beat saber, the Climb & pistol whip).

This inspired me to make Project Kenjutsu.
It will be a simple VR game where you will be able to get a feeling for cutting bamboo like samurai did for training and much more.
More on this project in another post.

On this moment my other project called “hollow” is put on a slight hold.
Because I'm also in need of time to study Japanese.

So a quick summary.
- New Project Called "Kenjutsu".
- “Hollow” put on hold.
- Comment section on the blog
- Still looking for an internship

That's it for now.

As always.

Your gracious host,
Altair.
