It has been a while since I last posted but there is a perfect reason why. 
In the last few weeks when I was setting up this blog/portfolio site I was also working on a huge school project.
More on that in the next post.

I have two tasks.
1. Make the Music Spectrum Analyzer for the project.
2. Draw/Make a good-looking poster

the first draft I made by hand in my notebook while it doesn't look like anything. It was a rough draft of the first idea that popped in my head.

after that, some time was taken to redraw and design the next version digitally.

while this looked fine for the standard specifications, I found it lacked a bit more color. 
So I went back to the drawing board again. 

This resulted in the final version which was handed in.

But the personal favorite among the group is this one.

that's it for now.

As always.

Your gracious host,
Altair.
